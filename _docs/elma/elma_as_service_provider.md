### Terminology
Here are some terms which will be used throughout this page.

- Service provider = A service provider is associated with one or more domains, and participants registered by the provider will only be approved for message exchange within the provider's domain(s).
- Access point provider = An access point provider operates access points that the server providers can use by making an agreement.
- Agreement = An agreement between a service provider and an access point provider for usage of a specific access point.
- Processes = Standardized, maintained collections of document types used in e-procurement.
- Participants = Are organizations that are connected to a specific endpoint. You can think of this as a "contract" between an organization and a Service provider.
- Access point = Represents a physical access point service endpoint, accessible through one or several URLs.
- Endpoint = An access point has one or more endpoints represented by a URL and transport profile.
- Certificates = Your PEPPOL access point certificate.
- Domains = Collections of processes used in e-procurement. 
- Document types = Standardized message types belonging to processes, used in communication between access points.
- Transport profile = The transport method to be used. AS4 is an example of a transport profile.
- Identifier = Consists of a set prefix and a organizational number. e.g. 9908:991825827
- SML (Service Metadata Locator) = A DNS that returns the address to the SMP that holds the metadata of a PEPPOL receiver. The SML is the only centrally operated component in the PEPPOL transport infrastructure. It is managed by OpenPEPPOL and operates out of Brussels by DG/DIGIT.

Note that process dependencies are shown. In a special case, when viewing a 0192-participant, profiles 
which are dependencies that are profiles on the 9908-sibling-participant will also be shown. Those dependencies 
are not processes on the 0192-participant, but are still shown in ELMA web. They are not visible in a SMP-lookup.

### Delete participant
To delete a participant you should be standing in the same window as above. (Endpoints->Your endpoint). From here you can click delete on the selected participant to remove it from your endpoint. If you attempt to delete a participant from the Participants view(pressing the home button) you will get an error. This delete button will be removed in a future release as it's not meant to be there.

### Applying for an Access Point agreement

If you want to use a specific access point, you need to make an agreement with the access point provider.
This can be initiated by pressing the "Apply for agreement"-button on the access point.

Then you will see a the New Agreement screen. You need to specify which domain the agreement is for. Click save when you're done.

![](images/elma/sp/agreement_new.PNG)

After the agreement is created, you will see something like this: 

![](images/elma/sp/agreement_no_certificate.PNG)

Notice that the agreement is not active yet. To activate the agreement you need to give the access point provider your certificate, so 
that they can install it in the access point. Then the access point provider will add the public key to the agreement.
As soon as the public key is added, you as the service provider, will be able to activate the agreement.  

Given that the access point provider has installed the certificate, then you will see something like this:

![](images/elma/sp/agreement_certificate_added.PNG)

You can now activate the agreement so that the participants belonging to the same domain as the agreement will be
recipients of the access point. Activate the agreement by pressing the "Activate"-button and get the following popup:   

![](images/elma/sp/agreement_activate_are_you_sure.PNG)

Confirm by pressing the "Yes, activate it!"-button.

## SML Queue

When adding or deleting a participant there will be sent a request to update the SML (Service Metadata Locator) accordingly.
The requests will be put on a queue and processed as soon as possible. Typically, within a minute. Below is a screenshot
of the SML queue containing one entry that hasn't yet been processed.

![](images/elma/sp/sml_queue.PNG)

There can be situations where the requests can't be processed. I.e. due to planned maintenance of the SML Application server or network problems.
Is such scenarios the operations will fail, but they will automatically be retried later on. The SML Queue screen shows the active queue.
Entries that are successfully executed will get status COMPLETED and will disappear after some time. 
Sometimes the same request will fail over and over again due to a specific problem. Then it is important to check the error message.
You can manually retry the request be pressing the Retry-button or delete the SML request by pressing the Delete-button.
