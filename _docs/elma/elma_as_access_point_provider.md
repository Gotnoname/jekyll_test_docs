### Terminology
Here are some terms which will be used throughout this page.

- Service provider = A service provider is associated with one or more domains, and participants registered by the provider will only be approved for message exchange within the provider's domain(s).
- Access point provider = An access point provider operates access points that the server providers can use by making an agreement.
- Agreement = An agreement between a service provider and an access point provider for usage of a specific access point.
- Processes = Standardized, maintained collections of document types used in e-procurement.
- Participants = Are organizations that are connected to a specific endpoint. You can think of this as a "contract" between an organization and a Service provider.
- Access point = Represents a physical access point service endpoint, accessible through one or several URLs.
- Endpoint = An access point has one or more endpoints represented by a URL and transport profile.
- Certificates = Your PEPPOL access point certificate.
- Domains = Collections of processes used in e-procurement. 
- Document types = Standardized message types belonging to processes, used in communication between access points.
- Transport profile = The transport method to be used. AS4 is an example of a transport profile.
- Identifier = Consists of a set prefix and a organizational number. e.g. 9908:991825827
- SML (Service Metadata Locator) = A DNS that returns the address to the SMP that holds the metadata of a PEPPOL receiver. The SML is the only centrally operated component in the PEPPOL transport infrastructure. It is managed by OpenPEPPOL and operates out of Brussels by DG/DIGIT.

## Access Points

At the top of the access point page a list of your access points will be displayed. If you have no access points, a 
"Get Started!" box will be displayed, making it easy to initiate the creation of your first access point.  
At the bottom of the page you will see a list of all access points in ELMA.

## Agreements

Here you will see agreements for usage of your access point by the service providers. 

![](images/elma/app/agreements.PNG)

The service providers initiate an agreement. The service provider will not be able to activate the agreement before you as the access point owner has added the
public key certificate belonging to the service provider. This should only be done after you have installed the key-pair in your access point.

### Adding a public key certificate

Select the agreement you want to add a public key certificate to by clicking the "View"-button. Then you will see the agreement page:

Then you press the "Add Certificate"-button:

Select the correct certificate type and the certificate itself and press the "Save"-button.

Now the agreement is ready for activation by the service provider.

## Certificates

To add, update or delete a certificate, you need to go to select an agreement first.

The certificates should be of a PEM format with a .crt or .cer file type.
